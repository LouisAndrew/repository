Project Roxstok

Was intended to just serve as a simple, fast and lightweight stock price viewer for 
US Stocks. I've managed to make it quite responsive, but ofc improvements are still needed.

Made using create-react-app, recharts.js, styled-components
and the Stock datas are provided by Finnhub API
